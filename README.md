# SE1 Interview Project @Emsi

## Provided Project Brief

We want you to recreate a small portion of one of our tools, Career Coach. Attached is an image mockup of what the final product looks like as well as some JSON data to help you with the data you need to display.

Your goal is to recreate the mockup to the best of your ability. We expect you to use React, but you are free to use whatever packages or methods of styling that you wish. We would suggest using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to get started quickly and not worry about the configuration side of the project. Icons similar to what we have in the mockup can be found here: https://ionicons.com/

## Project Requirements

- You must put your code onto GitHub. We will review it from there.
- Use small commits to git so that we can see how youâ€™ve developed your solution
- You must use React to develop the project.
- We will test your solution with another JSON file of the same shape.
- Please include a `README.md` file that outlines how to run it.

## Evaluation Criteria

- How readable your code is
- How close the final product is to the mockup (we aren't expecting perfection)
- How your solution handles our test JSON file
- How well you talk through your decisions in code review

## Extra

If you finish quickly and want an extra challenge, work on making your design responsive to different screen sizes.
